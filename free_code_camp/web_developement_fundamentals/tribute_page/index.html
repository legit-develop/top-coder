        <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
        <p>
          Clive William Barker (23 June 1944 – 10 June 2023) was a South African
          football coach. He guided the South Africa national team to their only
          African Nations Cup title in 1996
        </p>
        <p>
          Barker was born in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal. He became a professional
          footballer in the 1960s, playing for Durban City and Durban United
          having made his debut at the age of 17. He had a trial with Leicester
          City, but a serious knee injury quickly ended his career.
        </p>

        <h2 id="coaching-career">Coaching Career</h2>
        <p>
          In a coaching career that spanned 42 years, Barker mentored teams
          including AmaZulu, Manning Rangers, Durban City, Durban Bush Bucks,
          Santos Cape Town, Wits and, as his last assignment, Maritzburg United,
          which came to an end in 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
          Barker led Durban City to two back-to-back league titles in 1982 and
          1983 and the Durban Bush Bucks to the honours in 1985.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The Dog", as the coach is affectionately known in the fuootball
          circles will be remember for his role in helping the South African
          National Soccer team to win their first intercontinental cup in 1996,
          and his signature flying celebration whenever his team score a goal
        </p>

        <h2 id="african-cup">African Cup of Nations</h2>
        <p>
          South Africa didn’t debut in the African continental championships
          until 1996. With apartheid repealed by the early 1990s, the
          international bans on the country were lifted by the sporting
          community, yet, the team found itself thoroughly outmatched on its
          first attempt to qualify for the finals - both continental and
          international. South Africa would win just one of their six qualifying
          games for the 1994 AFCON and fail to make it past the early stages of
          the 1994 FIFA World Cup, CAF qualifiers.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the knockouts on their debut, South Africa eliminated African
          footballing giants Algeria and Ghana in back-to-back rounds before
          beating Tunisia to the title back in Johannesburg in front of an even
          larger crowd.
