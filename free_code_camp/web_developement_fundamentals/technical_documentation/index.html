          Getting started guide to Node.js, the server-side JavaScript runtime
          environment. Node.js is built on top of the Google Chrome V8
          JavaScript engine, and it's mainly used to create web servers - but
          it's not limited to just that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime
          environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!
        </p>

        <p>
          Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome,
          outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread
          for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O
          primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from
          blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using
          non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather
          than the norm.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network,
          accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread
          and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations
          when the response comes back.
        </p>
        <p>
          This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with
          a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread
          concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.

        <h3>How do I start with Node.js after I installed it?</h3>
        <p>
          Once we have installed Node.js, let's build our first web server.
          Create a file named app.js containing the following contents:
        </p>
        <pre>
      <code>
          const http = require('http');

          const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
          const port = 3000;

          const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
          res.statusCode = 200;
          res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
          res.end('Hello World');
          });

          server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
          console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
          });
      </code>
    </pre>
        <p>
          Now, run your web server using node app.js. Visit
          http://localhost:3000 and you will see a message saying "Hello World".
        </p>

          At this point, it is very clear that the password-based hash
          generation should be the target of our optimization. Thankfully,
          you've fully internalized the benefits of asynchronous programming and
          you realize that the work to generate a hash from the user's password
          is being done in a synchronous way and thus tying down the event loop.
          This prevents us from working on other incoming requests while
          computing a hash.
        </p>

        username = username.replace(/[!@#$%^&*]/g, '');

        if (!username || !password || !users[username]) {
        return res.sendStatus(400);
        }

        crypto.pbkdf2(password, users[username].salt, 10000, 512, 'sha512', (err, hash) => {
       if (users[username].hash.toString() === hash.toString()) {

        <h3>Intent</h3>
        <p>
          This document intends to extend the current threat model and provide
          extensive guidelines on how to secure a Node.js application.
        </p>

        <h3>Document Content</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Best practices: A simplified condensed way to see the best
            practices. We can use this issue or this guideline as the starting
            point. It is important to note that this document is specific to
            Node.js, if you are looking for something broad, consider OSSF Best
            Practices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Attacks explained: illustrate and document in plain English with
            some code example (if possible) the attacks that we are mentioning
            in the threat model.
          </li>
          <li>
            Third-Party Libraries: define threats (typosquatting attacks,
            malicious packages...) and best practices regarding node modules
            dependencies, etc...
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Denial of Service of HTTP server (CWE-400)</h3>
        <p>
          This is an attack where the application becomes unavailable for the
          purpose it was designed due to the way it processes incoming HTTP
          requests. These requests need not be deliberately crafted by a
          malicious actor: a misconfigured or buggy client can also send a
          pattern of requests to the server that result in a denial of service.

          npm is the world's largest software registry. Open source developers
          from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many
          organizations use npm to manage private development as well.
        </p>
        <p>npm consists of three distinct components:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>the website</li>
          <li>the Command Line Interface (CLI)</li>
          <li>the registry</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Use the website to discover packages, set up profiles, and manage
          other aspects of your npm experience. For example, you can set up
          organizations to manage access to public or private packages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The CLI runs from a terminal, and is how most developers interact with
          npm.
        </p>
        <p>
          The registry is a large public database of JavaScript software and the
          meta-information surrounding it.
        </p>

        <p>The current version you have on your system is checked by:</p>

        <pre>
      <code>$ node --version</code>
    </pre>

        <p>Packages are installed by using</p>

        <pre>
      <code>$ npm install [package spec...] </code>
